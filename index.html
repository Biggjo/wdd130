            Nigeria, often called the “Giant of Africa,” is a country in West Africa with a huge population and rich
            cultural
            diversity. Home to over 250 ethnic groups and hundreds of languages, it’s a place full of history,
            tradition, and
            creativity. Beyond its natural resources like oil and gas, Nigeria is also known for its lively cities such
            as Lagos and
            Abuja, its booming film industry Nollywood, and its globally celebrated Afrobeats music. It’s a country of
            energy and
            resilience, with people who are shaping culture both within Africa and around the world.
